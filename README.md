# WingBiology.jl

WingBiology.jl is a flexible aircraft design tool for configuration analysis and preliminary aerodynamics and structural estimation.
It currently allows for fully coupled aerostructural solutions with Newton's method and its derivatives, applied to beam elements, lifting line theory and state-space descriptions of flexible aircraft as dynamic systems.

## Usage examples

For a usage example, see examples/sample_acft.jl.

## Documentation

The full documentation for the program can be accessed using:

```
$ cd docs
